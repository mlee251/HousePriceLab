# HousePriceLab
### A Statistical and Machine Learning Exploration of Housing Prices

## 1. Project Overview

**HousePriceLab** is an end-to-end analytical study focused on understanding and predicting residential property prices using the **Ames Housing Dataset**, a widely recognized benchmark in both academic and industry contexts for modeling real-estate value.

The project integrates classical **statistical inference**, **information-theoretic concepts**, and **modern machine learning techniques** into a coherent analytical pipeline. Every step — from data cleaning to modeling and interpretation — is documented with clarity and methodological rigor.

A central goal of this project is to produce documentation that allows any reader to fully understand the reasoning, methodology, and conclusions **without needing to run the code**. The repository includes visual explanations, theoretical summaries, and narrative interpretations to support complete reproducibility and educational value.
