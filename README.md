# HousePriceLab
### A Statistical and Machine Learning Exploration of Housing Prices

## 1. Project Overview

**HousePriceLab** is an end-to-end analytical study focused on understanding and predicting residential property prices using the **Ames Housing Dataset**, a widely recognized benchmark in both academic and industry contexts for modeling real-estate value.

The project integrates classical **statistical inference**, **information-theoretic concepts**, and **modern machine learning techniques** into a coherent analytical pipeline. Every step — from data cleaning to modeling and interpretation — is documented with clarity and methodological rigor.

A central goal of this project is to produce documentation that allows any reader to fully understand the reasoning, methodology, and conclusions **without needing to run the code**. The repository includes visual explanations, theoretical summaries, and narrative interpretations to support complete reproducibility and educational value.

## 2. Objectives

The aim of **HousePriceLab** is to investigate, explain, and model residential property prices in the Ames housing market through a combination of statistical inference and machine learning.  
This project is designed to balance interpretability, methodological rigor, and predictive performance.

The main objectives are:

1. **Identify and quantify the factors most strongly associated with sale prices.**  
   This includes assessing structural characteristics, quality indicators, and neighborhood attributes using classical inferential methods.

2. **Evaluate the explanatory power of engineered and aggregated features.**  
   Derived variables will be used to test whether domain-informed transformations improve interpretability or model accuracy.

3. **Develop an interpretable baseline model using statistical techniques.**  
   Linear models and regularized variants will be used to form a transparent reference point.

4. **Build and compare predictive models using modern machine learning methods.**  
   Tree-based models and other supervised learning algorithms will be evaluated to determine gains in predictive accuracy.

5. **Analyze trade-offs between interpretability and predictive performance.**  
   The project will contrast the clarity of statistical models with the complexity of machine learning approaches.

6. **Investigate latent structure using dimensionality reduction and clustering.**  
   PCA and clustering methods will be used to explore underlying market patterns that are not directly observable.

7. **Provide clear, honest, and reproducible documentation and visualizations.**  
   The final deliverables aim to communicate evidence, uncertainty, limitations, and methodological decisions transparently.
